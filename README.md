# Organising, Cleaning, and Visualising Data

This digital research skills workshop covers organising data in spreadsheets, cleaning data with OpenRefine, and analysing/visualising data with R. We will be using a social sciences dataset (but the skills we cover are relevant for any discipline). This workshop will be delivered online over four half-days: 26 - 29 April with an optional lesson on managing data with SQL databases on 2 May.
